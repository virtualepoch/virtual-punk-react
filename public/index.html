      content="Welcome! This is a portfolio of 3D scenes created with react.js, three.js, and several of the react-three libraries. The libraries most heavily relied upon are react-three/drei and react-three/fiber. It also uses react-three/xr to view some scenes in VR. Please note, the VR feature is still being tested and is not optimized."
