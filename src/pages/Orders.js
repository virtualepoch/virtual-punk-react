          <p>&gt; If the driver or customer is calling in within 48 hours of delivery, PLEASE MAKE SURE TO OWN THE CALL.</p>
          <p>&gt; ONLY USE REASON CODE 45 FOR DAMAGE ALLOWANCES</p>
          <p>&gt; Markdowns above 25% will be declined by the vendor.</p>
          <h2>GM ORDERS</h2>
          <p>&gt; Start off with a lower amount (i.e. 5% - 10% off).</p>
          <p>&gt; Gauge the customers response then proceed.</p>
          <p>&gt; If they counter offer you should try to meet in the middle.</p>
          <p>&gt; Usually you will propose 15%-20% off.</p>
          <p>&gt; Always propose a dollar amount because it's tangible.</p>
          <p>&gt; BE SURE TO ALSO OFFER RETURN.</p>
          <p>&gt; ASK THEM: "Does this sound good to you?"</p>
          <h2>&gt; IF THE CUSTOMER HAS NO HISTORY OF ABUSE OR TRYING TO GET THINGS FOR FREE:</h2>
          <p>&gt; TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO SAY 'YES'.</p>
          <p>&gt; If item hasn't been delivered yet you can negotiate a MARKDOWN, however, you will just put this in the call notes then they will have to call back after delivery to get the MARKDOWN.</p>

          <p>&gt; NOTE: If there's no ship term in the fulfillment acronym then the item is charged when pulled from shelf.</p>
          <p>&gt; GM REFUNDS - usually take 3-5 business days.</p>
          <p>&gt; GM REFUNDS - If not shipped yet there is no charge.</p>
          <p>&gt; MA REFUNDS - usually take 7-10 business days. These take longer because they have to verify the item is accounted for.</p>
          <p>&gt; MA orders are not cancelable if already signed for. Delivery team will test and check appliance to ensure it works and not damaged. After signing customer has '48 HOURS TO REPORT DAMAGE OR DEFECT'.</p>
